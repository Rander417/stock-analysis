# Challenge

Refactor notes:
- Created buttons to run the analysis and clear the sheet. One button each

- Store volumes, starting prices & ending prices in arrays rather than indivudual variables

- Initialized all entries to 0 with for loop

- There is an assumption that the Data presented will be sorted by ticker value and the tickers array is in the same order

- This code will produce invlaid results if the data is unsorted

- Refactored to utilize (1) main loop resulting in a 12x efficiency gain by looping through the data once
